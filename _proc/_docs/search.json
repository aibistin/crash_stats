Most injuries and deaths occur during the evening rush hour, when traffic volume is at its highest and people are in a rush to get home. This is particularly evident on Fridays, when the urge to get home seems to be the greatest.\nI’m still curious as to why more motorist casualties on Saturday are equal to the Friday’s total. It could be because of Friday night “madness” or some other reason. I’d like to spend more time digging into that.\nIt’s also not too surprising that the cyclists are getting mowed down more often in the Summer months, as there are probably a lot more bikes on the road during those times.\nFor pedestrians, the upward trend in casualties from October to January is a little surprising. The December peak may be because of holiday shopping and holiday parties? That’s something I’ll spend more time analyzing in the future.\n\n\n\nThis Project on GitHub\nMe on Linkedin\n\n\nNYC Streetsblog\nHellgateNYC\nNYC Open Data\nnbdev really helped setup this blog post"

Most injuries and deaths occur during the evening rush hour, when traffic volume is at its highest and people are in a rush to get home. This is particularly evident on Fridays, when the urge to get home seems to be the greatest.\nI’m still curious as to why more motorist casualties on Saturday are equal to the Friday’s total. It could be because of Friday night “madness” or some other reason. I’d like to spend more time digging into that.\nIt’s also not too surprising that the cyclists are getting mowed down more often in the Summer months, as there are probably a lot more bikes on the road during those times.\nFor pedestrians, the upward trend in casualties from October to January is a little surprising. The December peak may be because of holiday shopping and holiday parties? That’s something I’ll spend more time analyzing in the future.\n\n\n\nThis Project on GitHub\nMe on Linkedin\n\n\nNYC Streetsblog\nHellgateNYC\nNYC Open Data\nnbdev really helped setup this blog post"
